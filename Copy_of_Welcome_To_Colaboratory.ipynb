            "On 12 August 1765, the Mughal  emperor  appointed  the  East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. As Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. Being  an  alien  power,  it  needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those  who  had  held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. 2 – A weekly market in Murshidabad in Bengal\n",
            "Peasants   and   artisans from rural areas regularly came to these weekly markets (haats)  to  sell their goods and buy what they needed. These markets were badly affected during times of economic crisis. 3 – Charles Cornwallis\n",
            "Cornwallis was the Governor- General of Bengal when the Permanent Settlement was introduced. Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. The problem\n",
            "The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that  the  zamindars were in fact not investing in  the  improvement  of  land. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently. To pay the rent he had to  often  take  a  loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to  pay  the rent, he  was  evicted  from  the  land  he  had  cultivated for generations. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its  expenses  of  administration and trade? Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring  the  fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to  calculate  the  revenue  that each  village  (mahal)  had  to  pay. This  demand   was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems  would  transform the peasants into  rich  enterprising  farmers. Crops for Europe\n",
            "The British  also  realised  that  the  countryside  could not only yield revenue, it could  also  grow  the  crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth  century, the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of  opium  and  indigo. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On  the  right  is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany  and Britain. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. By the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began  to  industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. The African slaves who worked on the plantations rose in rebellion in  1791,  burning the plantations and killing their rich planters. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by  directly  employing hired labourers. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo on the land of ryots\n",

            "In March 1859,  thousands  of  ryots  in  Bengal  refused to grow  indigo. Women  turned  up  to  fight   with   pots,   pans and kitchen implements. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters’ lathiyals – the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained  by the planters. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases.

            "The Company Becomes the Diwan\n",
            "On 12 August 1765, the Mughal  emperor  appointed  the  East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive’s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as  witnesses.  But  in  the  painting  above,  the  event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive’s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination.\n",
            "As Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its  revenue  resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the years, the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution.  Being  an  alien  power,  it  needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those  who  had  held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated.\n",
            "How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted.\n",
            "Revenue for the Company\n",
            "The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years, the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export.\n",
            "Soon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out.\n",

            "If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved.\n",
            "How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the  rajas  and  taluqdars  were  recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land.\n",
            "The problem\n",
            "The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that  the  zamindars were in fact not investing in  the  improvement  of  land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found  it  difficult  to  pay.  Anyone  who  failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris  were  sold  off  at  auctions  organised  by the Company.\n",
            "By the first decade of the nineteenth century, the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently.\n",
            "Even then the  zamindars  did  not  have  an  interest in improving the  land.  Some  had  lost  their  lands  in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land.\n",

            "On the other hand,  in  the  villages,  the  cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to  often  take  a  loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to  pay  the rent, he  was  evicted  from  the  land  he  had  cultivated for generations.\n",
            "A new system is devised\n",
            "By the early nineteenth century, many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its  expenses  of  administration and trade?\n",
            "In the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised  the new system which came into effect  in  1822.  He  felt that the village  was  an  important  social  institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring  the  fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to  calculate  the  revenue  that each  village  (mahal)  had  to  pay.  This  demand   was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to  the  village  headman,  rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement.\n",
            "The Munro system\n",
            "In the British territories in the South, there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India.\n",
            "Read and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots ) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British\n",

Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems  would  transform the peasants into  rich  enterprising  farmers.  But  this did not happen.\n",

By the late eighteenth  century, the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of  opium  and  indigo.  In  the  century  and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal,  tea  in  Assam,  sugarcane  in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton  in  Maharashtra  and  Punjab,  rice in Madras.\n",

            "The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century  Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time.\n",
            "Why the demand for Indian indigo?\n",
            "The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\n",
            "However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany  and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their  governments  to ban the import of indigo.\n",
            "Cloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America.\n",
            "By the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began  to  industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply.\n",
            "From where could this indigo be procured?\n",
            "Britain turns to India\n",
            "Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation.\n",

            "How was indigo cultivated?\n",
            "There were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that  he  directly  controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by  directly  employing hired labourers.\n",
            "The problem with nij cultivation\n",
            "The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension.\n",
            "Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation.\n",

This meant that a planter with 1,000  bighas  would  need  2,000  ploughs.   Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their  ploughs  and  bullocks  were  busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them.\n",
            "Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation – the ryoti system.\n",

Women  turned  up  to  fight   with   pots,   pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas – agents of planters – who came  to  collect  rent  were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters’ lathiyals – the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained  by the planters.\n",

In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters.

When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion.\n",

The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for  the  coercive  methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future.\n",

            "On 12 August 1765, the Mughal  emperor  appointed  the  East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive’s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as  witnesses.  But  in  the  painting  above,  the  event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive’s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination.\n",
            "As Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its  revenue  resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted.\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the years, the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution.  Being  an  alien  power,  it  needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those  who  had  held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated.\n",
            "How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted.\n",
            "Revenue for the Company\n",
            "The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years, the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export.\n",
            "Soon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out.\n",

            "If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved.\n",
            "How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the  rajas  and  taluqdars  were  recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land.\n",
            "The problem\n",
            "The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that  the  zamindars were in fact not investing in  the  improvement  of  land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found  it  difficult  to  pay.  Anyone  who  failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris  were  sold  off  at  auctions  organised  by the Company.\n",
            "By the first decade of the nineteenth century, the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently.\n",
            "Even then the  zamindars  did  not  have  an  interest in improving the  land.  Some  had  lost  their  lands  in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land.\n",

            "On the other hand,  in  the  villages,  the  cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to  often  take  a  loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to  pay  the rent, he  was  evicted  from  the  land  he  had  cultivated for generations.\n",
            "A new system is devised\n",
            "By the early nineteenth century, many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its  expenses  of  administration and trade?\n",
            "In the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised  the new system which came into effect  in  1822.  He  felt that the village  was  an  important  social  institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring  the  fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to  calculate  the  revenue  that each  village  (mahal)  had  to  pay.  This  demand   was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to  the  village  headman,  rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement.\n",
            "The Munro system\n",
            "In the British territories in the South, there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India.\n",
            "Read and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots ) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British\n",

Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems  would  transform the peasants into  rich  enterprising  farmers.  But  this did not happen.\n",

By the late eighteenth  century, the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of  opium  and  indigo.  In  the  century  and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal,  tea  in  Assam,  sugarcane  in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton  in  Maharashtra  and  Punjab,  rice in Madras.\n",

            "The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century  Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time.\n",
            "Why the demand for Indian indigo?\n",
            "The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\n",
            "However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany  and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their  governments  to ban the import of indigo.\n",
            "Cloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America.\n",
            "By the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began  to  industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply.\n",
            "From where could this indigo be procured?\n",
            "Britain turns to India\n",
            "Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation.\n",

In 1788, only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent.\n",

            "How was indigo cultivated?\n",
            "There were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that  he  directly  controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by  directly  employing hired labourers.\n",
            "The problem with nij cultivation\n",
            "The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension.\n",
            "Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation.\n",

            "Nij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000  bighas  would  need  2,000  ploughs.   Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their  ploughs  and  bullocks  were  busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them.\n",
            "Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation – the ryoti system.\n",

As  the  rebellion  spread,  ryots  refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and  spears,  bows  and arrows.  Women  turned  up  to  fight   with   pots,   pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas – agents of planters – who came  to  collect  rent  were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters’ lathiyals – the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained  by the planters.\n",

In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters.
